## What is this? ##

DotFiles is a cute name for the hidden files in a home directory. This
repository is used to share these user configurations across multiple
systems.

## How to install ##

Run the following commands

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/btorresgil/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
    .dotfiles/install.sh

The last command will symlink the files to the home directory.
